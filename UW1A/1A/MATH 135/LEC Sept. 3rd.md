**Set Notation**
$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural number
$\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of integers
$\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of all numbers of form $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \in \mathbb(Z) \setminus \{0\}$
$\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all real numbers

Parity: even or odd

b) Seeking help is a tip that resonates with me. Whenever encountering a problem, I will always try to solve it alone, which typically goes awfully wrong. When I was in CEGEP, I frequently seek help for tough questions. Professors and classmates are very open towards the discussion and give inspiration tips to help me find the solution. This reminds me that there is a whole community that is surrounding me with resources and kindness, and it is never too late to reach out to others than fighting alone.
